Here’s a professional and detailed README.md file for your Advanced Time Series Forecasting project:

# 📈 Advanced Time Series Forecasting on Real-World Data

This project demonstrates the application of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to forecast real-world time series data. We use the classic **AirPassengers** dataset to predict monthly airline passenger counts for the next 12 months.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

- To forecast future values from historical time series data using various modeling techniques.
- To compare the performance of traditional, ML, and DL models.
- To develop a reusable forecasting pipeline applicable to similar datasets.
